MQTT Client with tasker integration Android app
Connect to any MQTT v3.1 broker and subscribe to topics. Perform Tasker actions on message publish or publish messages on tasker events. The app still might be rough around the edges. 

Tasker Integration works as follows:

-To publish messages from tasker simply create a action in tasker. The configuration is pretty simple. You may use tasker variables in topic and message.

-To perform action whenever a message is received. Create a event in tasker from the plugin. Currently if any message is published on the topic configured, the event will be fired. need feedback on this as to how you guys want this to be implemented.

-No Ads!

-Add/Remove topics easily!
